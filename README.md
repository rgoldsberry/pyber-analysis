# pyber-analysis
Data Analysis Bootcamp - Week 5

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze data from a rideshare company, PyBer, and create displays for a presentation comparing the company's position in urban, suburban, and rural locations. A summary of the requested deliverables is included below. The last two will be the main focus of this report.

> Deliverables:
> - Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
> - Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
>     - The total number of rides for each city type.
>     - The average fares for each city type.
>     - The total number of drivers for each city type.
> - Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
>     - The number of rides for each city type.
>     - The fares for each city type.
>     - The number of drivers for each city type.
> - Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
>     - The percent of total fares.
>     - The percent of total rides.
>     - The percent of total drivers.
> - A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type.
> - A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

## Resources 
- Data Sources: [city_data.csv](resources/city_data.csv), [ride_data.csv](resources/ride_data.csv)
- Software: Python 3.7.13, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8

## Analysis

This analysis was worked in a Jupyter Notebook, written with Python and largely relying on the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. We were delivered two csvs, one containing rider data and one containing data about the cities the company operates in. We were able to merge the rider and city data csvs into one working data frame by using the "city" column. From this combined dataframe we had all the information we needed to calculate the requested statistics and displays. The results below will focus on the summary data frame and multiple-line chart of total fares by city type deliverables created for the challenge.

## Results
Describe some differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## Summary
Summarize three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. get more rural drivers in on festival days
2. d
3. 3
